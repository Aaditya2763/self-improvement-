# Variables, Scope & Hoisting

## Learning Objectives
- Understand var, let, and const
- Master function and block scope
- Learn hoisting mechanisms
- Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

## Topics

### 1. Variable Declaration
- var, let, const differences
- Scope rules
- Re-declaration and reassignment

### 2. Hoisting
- Function hoisting
- Variable hoisting
- Execution context

### 3. Temporal Dead Zone
- TDZ concept
- How it prevents bugs
- ReferenceError causes

## Key Concepts
- **Scope**: Where variables are accessible
- **Hoisting**: Moving declarations to top
- **TDZ**: Dead zone for let/const before declaration

## Practice Tasks
- [ ] Create functions with different variable types
- [ ] Understand scope chain
- [ ] Predict hoisting behavior
- [ ] Work with closures and scope

## Interview Tips
- Explain difference between var and let/const clearly
- Know hoisting rules for functions vs variables
- Understand TDZ and why it exists
